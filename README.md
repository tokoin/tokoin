## What is it?
Tokoin is just a cryptocurrency made for fun, just a hobby. It's a Peer-To-Peer electronic cash system built with C++ 
It's scratch built and based on cryptographic systems. It uses hashing to protect manipulations on the blockchain, and RSA encryption 
method for Peer-To-Peer encryption.

## Usage
It has no actual usage. I don't want you to invest your money in it or something like that. Like I said it's just a hobby project.

## Development Goals
- [x] Implement hashing
- [x] Implement RSA encryption method
- [ ] Implement Networking
- [ ] Implement GUI
